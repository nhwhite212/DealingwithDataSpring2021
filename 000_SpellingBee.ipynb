Then do a spell check on that word, if it passes, keep it.  Each word counts as a point, words that use all 7 letters count as 3 points. Do that \"many\" times. I did a few million. It pretty much worked, usually getting close to the NY times publshed answers, and sometime exceeding them. BUT, it ran a LONG time. \n",

I think the NY Times defines \"common\" as among the top X words by frequency. The example I gave above is from the Sunday Times on March 28. Their answers were  worth 38 points. I initially found over 200 words, but that was using a dictionary of all the words in the US English dictionary, most of which I had never heard of.\n",
