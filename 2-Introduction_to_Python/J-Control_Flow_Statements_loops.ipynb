        "We've spent some time going into detail about some of the data types and structures available in python. It's now time to talk about how to navigate through some of this data, and use data to make decisions. Traversing over data and making decisions based upon data are a common aspect of every programming language, known as control flow. Python provides a rich control flow, with a lot of conveniences for the power users. Here, we're just going to talk about the basics, to learn more, please [consult the documentation](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html). \n",

We'll see examples below. \n",
