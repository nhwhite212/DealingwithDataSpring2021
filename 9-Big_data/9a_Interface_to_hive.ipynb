    "# Big Data and Python  (UPDATED to work with python 3 and pyhive\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Data clusters usually offer HIVE as an SQL like interface. This allows end-users who do not know how to write \n",
    "map-reduce code, or PIG or Java to manipulate files in the HDFS. The way they do this is to treat a folder of files as a table. Each file in the folder has to have the same structure. Typically, the folder contains files which are collected\n",
    "over time, so every minute, hour, day another file is added. Users can then search, filter, join, merge the files using HQL, the HIVE QUERY LANGUAGE.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, many analytical packages support remote access to Relational Data Bases. Examples being SAS, SPSS, R, Tableau, python, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Hive supports Hive server, which allows remote connections to HIVE, and allows remote execution of HQL commands. This allows a wide range of capabilities for analytical packages to use HIVE to do their back-end processing, and then pull the results to do analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will try to use this to  connect our IPYTHON  notebooks to the Stern big data cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first we need to install some software.\n",
    "We need to install a package called pyhive and thrift_sasl\n"
